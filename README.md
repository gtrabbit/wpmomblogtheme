Sparkle Rune
===

Sparkle Rune is a simple blog theme for WordPress. The primary colors are green and pink. The theme integrates with all the standard WordPress event hooks, so simply start blogging as you would with any of the standard themes.

Getting Started
---------------

First, you will need an installation of WordPress. If you've got that already, simply clone this repo into your themes directory at `~wordpress/wp-content/themes`. Next, open up the WordPress dashboard, navigate to the theme selection menu, and activate "Sparkle Rune" (it's named after my cat). 

To get the theme looking nice, you will need to set a custom header image, and create a new menu called "Menu 1". This menu is attached to your header and footer and is used to provide a standard set of static links for "about" pages and the like. Once you've done that, you're good to go. Have fun.
